# Spatial patterns of seasonal ridership, built environment and social demographics: A taxonomy of Bike Share Toronto stations

This project was completed as part of an advanced GIS course, [GGRC30](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ggrc30h3), taught by [Dr. Elnaz Yousefzadeh Barri](https://elnazyousefzadeh.com/) in the Fall of 2022. The project focused on the Bike Share Toronto system, and aimed to answer two research questions below through the use of Earth Mover's Distance and Hierarchical Clustering from Vertex-links.
-	RQ1. What are the seasonal spatial pattern differences in Toronto bike-share trips at station levels?
-	RQ2. What are the similarities and differences between the locations, trip count percentages, built environments, and social demographics of Toronto bike-share stations?
